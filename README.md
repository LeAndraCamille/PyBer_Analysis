Pyber Analysis 

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
        The purpose of the new analysis is to show an overview of the amount of ridesharing in different cities as in surburban, urban, and rural. 



Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences 
in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
    The line chart represents the summary of the dataframe regarding the ride-sharing in different city types. The yellow represents rural city. The color red represnts the urban city. Lastly, blue represents the surburban city. 
    By looking at the line chart you'll noticed that the rural city is farely low in price from the month of January-April. The highest in total fares is $500. Comparing to the surburban city 
    from January-April stayed in the $1000-$1500 range. By having this amount of total fares, this brings the surburban city in the middle range of rural and urban cities. 
    Lastly, Urban cities total fares from the months of January to April ranged $1500-$2500. Urban city has the greatest total fares. 


Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing 
any disparities among the city types.

Three business recommendations I would give the CEO is having more venues or tourist attractions in all cities. 
More events around the month of Feburary and March. In all three cities it shows a decline within those months. 
Lastly, I would recommend raising prices in the rural area, because of it being outside of the city. 
It should cost more due to longer travel time/milege.
